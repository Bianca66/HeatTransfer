# Heat Transfer

# Introduction
Physical simulations can be among the most computationally challenging problems to solve. Fundamentally, there is often a trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. As a result, computer simulations have become more and more important in recent years, thanks in large part to the increased accuracy possible because of the parallel computing revolution. Since many physical simulations can be parallelized quite easily, we will look at a very simple simulation model in this example.
In this paper, it simulated the heat transfer in a Microfluidic Device. The program receives an image with sensor model, computes heat transfer for a specific number of steps and make a short video with heat animation. 

# Objective
• Implementation of the serial implementation of the algorithm 

• Implementation of the algorithm to check for the correctitude of the proposed method 

• Implementation of the parallel implementation of the algorithm and optimize the results for the proposed paradigm
